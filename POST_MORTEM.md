Post Mortem - 13th Restaurant Rush - js13kGames 2024

## Initial Goals
The main goal was to create a game that aligned with the given theme. That's what I enjoy most about game jams—the imposed constraints. From the start, I knew I wanted to make a game that had some level of challenge and allowed players to improve as they played. I’ve always liked the idea of a scoring system, so this naturally became a core mechanic in my design.

## Technical Choices
I spent a good amount of time debating whether to use the canvas element or stick to the DOM for rendering. While canvas could have provided more polished visuals, it required learning new techniques that would have taken too much time given my tight schedule. In the end, I opted for simplicity and went with the DOM, which allowed me to focus more on the core mechanics and the game logic.

## Time Management
Time was by far my biggest constraint. Balancing game development with a family, including a nearly three-year-old and a five-month-old, meant I had very little time to dedicate to the project. This explains the simplicity of the final game. Once I had the core idea, I immediately jumped into prototyping. After I had a working prototype, I focused on refining the interface, transitioning from a basic card-based prototype to the current graphical and UI layout. Also I prepared my todo list during the day. This way when I was ready to work on it, I knew what to do and I didn't lost time.

## Challenges Faced
Apart from time, one of the major challenges was working within the constraints of js13kGames. I expected the 13 KB size limit to be extremely restrictive, but it turned out to be less of an issue than I initially thought. I lost some time optimizing too soon during the development. The other challenge was maintaining the quality of the game while rushing to meet the deadline. I didn’t have time to eliminate all the bugs, and I feel the game could have been more polished in some areas.

## Creative Process
The game’s idea stemmed from a conversation with my wife about the saying, "Never 13 at the table." I brainstormed a few different concepts, including one where players managed multiple tables in a restaurant, trying to keep the number of guests balanced. Eventually, I settled on the idea of rewriting orders, with a high-score mechanic to reward precision. In the first version, all orders were visible, but later I changed it so that only the current order was shown, which added to the challenge.

## Final Product Feedback
I’m happy with the result—it’s a finished game and, more importantly, it’s fun! That said, I wish I could have enhanced the visuals, especially the feedback for losing lives and gaining points, which are not as clear as I would like. There are also a few bugs that I didn’t have time to address. Given more time, I would have added a bonus screen with power-ups or small abilities to keep the gameplay more dynamic. I’d also like to improve the order generation system to reduce repetition.

## Lessons Learned
The biggest lesson for me was realizing that I could complete the project, despite the challenges. This has been a huge motivation booster, and I’m eager to take on more side projects. I now have a better understanding of what I can achieve with a regular routine and a set deadline, even with limited time due to family commitments.
