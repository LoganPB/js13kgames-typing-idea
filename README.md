# 13th Restaurant Rush: A Test of Speed and Tradition

In 13th Restaurant Rush, speed is key, but tradition is just as important! According to an old saying, there should never be more than 12 people seated at a table. This restaurant takes that very seriously, and it’s up to you to maintain the balance while typing orders as fast as possible!

The challenge? Keep the line moving and don’t let more than 12 people wait for a seat, or face the consequences. Every second counts!

# Here are the golden rules to remember:

- No more than 12 customers can be in line at once! Serve them quickly or lose the game.
- Never serve an order if the total of its items equals thirteen!

## How to Play

- Type each element order in the input field and hit Enter. Example: "2 carrots"
- If the total of the order adds up to 13, type **refuse order** instead.

Be sure to keep the flow moving and never let more than 12 customers wait!
It’s a fast-paced, number-crunching challenge that tests both your typing skills and your mental math. How many orders can you serve before the line grows too long?


It's my first participation, I hope you'll like it!
Don't hesitate to follow me on X if you liked the game and want to keep in touch.

This won't be the proposal with the most technical challenge inside. My challenge was to found enough time to finish my project with two young daughters!
